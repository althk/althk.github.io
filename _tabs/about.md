# About Me
_pronouns: he/him_

I work in big tech as an engineer, solving enterprise problems.

As of 2021, I have a bit over 18 years of experience in IT and application development. Off late, my professional interests have been product excellence, operational excellence and human excellence, not necessarily in the same order.

I have spent almost three decades of my life in Hyderabad, India and about a decade in the Bay Area (California, USA).

My personal interests (apart from spending time with my son) are, spending time with my son, trekking, listening to music, and trying to understand cultures and religion.

I like to keep things simple and uncomplicated. I value nature and try to live like a minimalist (at least when it comes to my own things).

For the sake of our children, I want to leave this world in a better place than what it is today. _Imagine_.
